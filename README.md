# Wego Project

Wego stands for Week-End GO. Its aims at providing the user with good tips for the week-end based on his/her favorite places, sports and the weather forecast.
After signing-in, the user can choose and sort a list of up to 5 favorite places and up to 5 favorite sports. He/she can specify which sport is practiced in which place to tune the week-end tips finely.

## What could be improved ?
* Security: by using JWT token
* Search for places: by providing the user with a leaflet map
* Additonal sports: the list of sport is new limited and the user cannot add sports to the database
* Communication: by pushing the user a notification to his/her smartphone 
* Layout customization: choice of profile picture, accessibility for visualy impaired people
* Smart app: more control of the user's input (ex: should we really accept that the user choose Saint Brieuc as a place for skying?)
