# Our understanding of the subject

We designed an app that allows the user to choose places and outdoor sports from a list and then organize them according to their preference order. Users have the possibility to associate one sport to many places and one place to many sports. They can reorganize the lists as they want (change the preference for each item, delete some etc.).

A place is mainly a town name and a zip code located in France.
Each sport is associated with an IdealWeather i.e. the weather required to practive this out sport.

The algorithm for week-end advice is "place-first": if the wheather is good enough to practice a sport (even the lower-ranked one) in the top-ranked place, this advice will be given to the user.
